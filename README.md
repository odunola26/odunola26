## 🧬 About Me

I am a PhD candidate in **Immunology** with a strong foundation in **bioinformatics**, working at the intersection of **tuberculosis (TB) biology**, **spatial transcriptomics**, and **single-cell RNA sequencing**.

My research focuses on **human TB granulomas**, particularly pediatric lymph node and lung lesions, where I investigate:
- immune microenvironment heterogeneity  
- macrophage and myeloid cell states  
- hypoxia-associated and immunosuppressive niches  
- host-directed therapy–relevant pathways  

I work extensively with **10x Visium (FFPE & HD)**, scRNA-seq (BAL, PBMC), and integrative computational pipelines to derive biologically interpretable insights from complex spatial data.
